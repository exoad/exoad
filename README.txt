programming in a corpo  
   job isn’t real   
       programming—  
  it’s just office  
      politics and  
people bs-ing their  
way up the "corpo  
       ladder."  
   real programming  
    is what open-   
    source devs do,  
only to have their  
   work leeched by  
  big corpos for    
   their ai shit.
