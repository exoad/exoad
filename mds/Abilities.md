# [Abilities]
For the most part I either do CS for research or plainly for fun, however this means that I mostly take CS challenges as "fun" or something I can attribute to my
interest for CS. To put it simply, I do not consider inschool assignments as some I attribute to my CS-abilites (APCS, data structures, etc.). 

Some of these challenges I often persue are:
1. CP (Competitive Programming) | AKA: USACO, CodeForces, AtCoder, LeetCode, GCJ, FBHC, etc.
2. CTF (Capture the Flag) | AKA: PicoCTF, or my school's, etc.
3. Research: Functional Programming & Informatics
4. For Fun | AKA: Computer Science in Game Theory
5. Framework & Engines for random purposes (audio, video-processing, media-transcoding, etc.)

## Frameworks & Languages
*A simple list of frameworks & languages I am comfortable with*
1. Elixir
2. C++ -> Native Frameworks
3. OpenGL & OpenCL
4. Sugar
5. qt & UPP
6. JVM & JNI
7. OpenCV
8. Hedwig
