# [Abilities]
For the most part I either do CS for research or plainly for fun, however this means that I mostly take CS challenges as "fun" or something I can attribute to my
interest for CS. To put it simply, I do not consider inschool assignments as some I attribute to my CS-abilites (APCS, data structures, etc.). 

Some of these challenges I often persue are:
1. CP (Competitive Programming) | AKA: USACO, CodeForces, AtCoder, LeetCode, GCJ, FBHC, etc.
2. CTF (Capture the Flag) | AKA: PicoCTF, etc.
3. Research Projects (Paper & Data Analysis) | AKA: Machine Learning, Functional Programming
4. For Fun | AKA: Game dev, Web dev, etc.
5. Framework or library aided for fun | AKA: Personal research projects
