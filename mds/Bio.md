# [Bio]

My name is Jack (Meng). I currently attend High School. My favorite languages are Elixir, C++ & C. For the most part, Elixir because it has of course (in my opinion a cool name) & also because of how well it suited me. C++ & C just because I mostly had to learn it for my projects, and they are pretty free to do anything with.

# My System Environment

**WM** i3, BSPWM (FORKED), PLASMA, DWM

**Terminal/Shell** zsh, Alacritty, Kitty, fish shell (OLD)
