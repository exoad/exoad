# [Bio]

My name is Jack (Meng). I currently attend High School. My favorite languages are Elixir, C++ & C. For the most part, I use Elixir to accomplish
my tasks. However I am also pretty skilled in C++ & Java or other OOP languages. Most of the time Elixir for some backend and Java/C++ for some
front-end UI interactions.

I currently do not have any specific targets in the field of CS and I just create random projects for fun. However, I am primarily focused on learning more about compiler design and software optimizations; sub-routines. 

Some other goals I have is making software applications; although I am less experienced with making "usable" GUI programs, I like to create independent frameworks for whatever they are purposing. For example, Halcyon, my latest project, utilizes a modified version of an Audio Library.
