# hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jack, and I am a freshman in college studying Computer Science, with a focus on systems and compilers. 

I use various languages and frameworks when needed, but my expertise lies with **C/C++**, **Java**, and **Kotlin**. I have utilized all of these in some form in over **50** of my projects that are hosted publicly on GitHub.
